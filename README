mupe - MUltiPath Estimater
==========================

This script was originally written to evaluate RSSI signal strength jitter
for 802.11 based wireless lan networks. The script expects tcpdump/tshark
PCAP files w/ Radiotap headers.

The processing is based on timeslots (default 2sec). The following
data is processed:

- beacon frames
    - MAC clock difference
	charts the clock difference between the AP STA and the
	sniffing STA

    - losses:
	charts lost frames per timeslot

    - signal distribution:
	charts RSSI distribution of the hole capture

    - signal jitter:
	charts MAX-MIN RSSI per timeslot

    - signal trend:
	charts MIN/AVG/MAX RSSI per timeslot


- data frames

    - signal distribution:
	charts RSSI distribution of the hole capture

    - signal jitter:
	charts MAX-MIN RSSI per timeslot

    - signal trend:
	charts MIN/AVG/MAX RSSI per timeslot
